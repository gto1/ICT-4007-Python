This is a concise illustration of applying the seven-step “Bulletproof Problem Solving” method (Conn & McLean) to a *commonplace* scenario where you use Python to analyze and reduce personal monthly expenses.

## 1. Define the Problem

**Problem Statement:**  
You notice you’ve been spending more money than usual each month. Your goal is to reduce your monthly expenses by 10% without sacrificing essential items or services.

**Context and Success Criteria:**  
- You have 12 months of transaction data in a CSV file.  
- Success is defined as identifying specific expense categories to cut back on so that your average monthly spending decreases by at least 10%.

## 2. Disaggregate (Break Down) the Issues

Think about what drives monthly expenses. You might categorize transactions by:
- **Rent/Mortgage**  
- **Utilities** (electricity, gas, water, internet)  
- **Groceries**  
- **Dining Out**  
- **Entertainment** (streaming subscriptions, movies)  
- **Travel & Transportation** (public transit, rideshares, car-related expenses)  
- **Miscellaneous** (clothing, gifts, hobbies)

Your “logic tree” might look like:

```
Monthly Expenses
|
+-- Fixed
|    +-- Rent/Mortgage
|    +-- Utilities
|
+-- Variable
     +-- Groceries
     +-- Dining Out
     +-- Entertainment
     +-- Transportation
     +-- Miscellaneous
```

## 3. Prioritize Where to Focus

- **Fixed expenses** (rent, car payments) are stable but could still offer opportunities (e.g., renegotiating a lease or switching internet providers).  
- **Variable expenses** (dining out, entertainment, groceries) often have more “easy wins” for immediate reduction.  

Based on your data, you might identify the top two or three expense categories that drive the most variable spending. These are likely the highest-impact areas where small changes could lead to big savings.

---

## 4. Develop a Workplan

1. **Gather data**: Import the CSV file into Python and ensure it has consistent columns (e.g., `date`, `category`, `amount`).
2. **Clean & prepare data**: Handle missing values or inconsistent categories.
3. **Analyze monthly spending**: Group transactions by month and category to see the average spend per category.
4. **Evaluate reduction strategies**: Identify categories that could be cut (or renegotiated).
5. **Set a target**: E.g., a 10% reduction from your current average monthly baseline.

---

## 5. Conduct Analyses (Python Example)

Below is a simplified example using **pandas** to analyze the data.

```python
import pandas as pd

# 1) Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('expenses.csv') 
# Assume columns: ['date', 'category', 'amount']

# 2) Convert date column to datetime, if needed
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# 3) Create a month column for grouping
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.to_period('M')

# 4) Summarize expenses by month and category
monthly_expenses = df.groupby(['month', 'category'])['amount'].sum().reset_index()

# 5) Calculate total monthly spending
total_monthly = monthly_expenses.groupby('month')['amount'].sum().reset_index()
average_spend = total_monthly['amount'].mean()

print(f"Average monthly spend (all categories): ${average_spend:,.2f}")

# 6) Identify top spending categories on average
category_summary = (
    monthly_expenses.groupby('category')['amount']
    .mean()
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={'amount': 'avg_spend'})
    .sort_values(by='avg_spend', ascending=False)
)

print("Average spend per category (high to low):")
print(category_summary)
```

**Interpreting the Results:**  
- You’ll see an output like:
  ```
  Average monthly spend (all categories): $3,000.00
  Average spend per category (high to low):
       category      avg_spend
    0  Rent/Mortgage    1500
    1  Utilities         300
    2  Dining Out        250
    3  Groceries         250
    4  Entertainment     200
    5  ...              ...
  ```
- In this example, *Rent/Mortgage* is clearly the largest chunk, but *Dining Out* and *Entertainment* might be easier to cut by 10–20%.

---

## 6. Synthesize Findings

Based on the analysis:
- **High-level insight**: Variable expenses on *Dining Out* and *Entertainment* are significant.  
- **Actionable recommendation**: Reduce dining out (maybe cook at home more) and consider fewer subscription services or less frequent entertainment purchases.  
- **Potential monthly savings**: If you spend \$250 per month on dining out, reducing by 20% saves \$50. Entertainment at \$200/month reduced by 25% saves \$50. That’s already \$100 saved per month. Alongside minor tweaks in other categories, you could hit or exceed the 10% overall reduction goal.

---

## 7. Communicate the Solution

In a professional or educational setting, you might prepare a short slide deck or written summary:

- **Key findings**:  
  1. Average monthly spend is \$3,000, with rent at 50% of that.  
  2. Dining Out (8.3% of total) and Entertainment (6.7% of total) can be reduced easily.  
- **Recommendation**:  
  Cut $50 from each Dining Out and Entertainment categories per month to meet the 10% total reduction target.  
- **Next steps**:  
  Revisit fixed expenses in the future (e.g., see if you can get a better utility rate or move to a cheaper apartment/house).

# Why This Example Works

- **Relatable**: Everyone deals with living expenses.  
- **Teaches a Data-Driven Approach**: Gathering real transaction data and systematically analyzing it.  
- **Shows the Full 7-Step Method**: From clarifying your 10% reduction goal (Step 1) through sharing the final recommendation (Step 7).  
- **Reinforces Python Skills**: Demonstrates basic data manipulation and summary statistics in pandas.  

By exploring this example, students or working professionals can see how the *Bulletproof Problem Solving* framework fits neatly with Python’s data analysis capabilities to arrive at well-founded, actionable conclusions.
